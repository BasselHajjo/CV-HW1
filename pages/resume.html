<h1 class="resume">New in Denmark and ready to work!</h1>
<p>I am 30 years old and have come to Denmark as a refugee from Syria. I have a desire to find a job that makes me first and foremost able to support myself, and then let me join in social and professional contexts where I can improve my Danish language, and gain insight into how it works is to be a part of the Danish labor market in terms of mutual expectations, development, accountability and colleagues together.</p>
<p>I am positive by nature, I look forward to being on my own again. I'm not critical of the content of any work, and I learn to adapt quickly. of course, It is a challenge that I do not have a very high degree, speaks Danish. On the other hand, I am a master of making flaws and international facial expressions, and you can actually achieve a great deal by just talking quietly and trying out.</p>
<p>As a refugee, I will be included in the first years after my arrival in Denmark in what is called the integration period, and has the status of integration citizen. that besides receiving tuition in Danish, I have the opportunity to offer your company different support schemes in cooperation with Jobcenter Furesø, if you choose to hire me. These arrangements include Wage subsidies where the job center covers part of wage costs for an agreed period. A wage subsidy scheme can be very beneficial to the company, but also to me as it is a way into working life and gives me a chance to show my worth. If you would like more information about wage subsidies and other offers from the Job Center, you can find more information by clicking on <a href="https://job.jobnet.dk/CV" target="_blank"> www.jobnet.dk</a></p>
<p>If you would like to know more about me and my background, you can read more about my competences and previous professional experiences in my resume that is attached to this application.</p>
<p>I hope that you will be looking forward to my application, and if you want to see me for a chat, I will of course be available, and I would like to bring you both an interpreter and a representative from Jobcenter Furesø who can tell you more about the different support schemes and opportunities.</p>
